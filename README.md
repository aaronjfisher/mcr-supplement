# MCR

Scripts to calculate model reliance, model class reliance, and other functions for Rashomon sets.


* *simulations* - contains code to generate the polynomial classifier example in our paper
* *propublica-analysis* - contains code to generate our applied results. The data file used in this analysis was downloaded from the "compas-scores-two-years.csv" file, at [https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis/tree/bafff5da3f2e45eca6c2d5055faad269defd135a)

The scripts in both of these files call scripts located in the *general-scripts* folder.
